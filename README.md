# OSL_Perl


This is a music developed in perl. For now this simple version can play any song of your choice. 
You can pause, resume and play any other song
while one song is being played.

The application is developed to get introduction to perl GUI programming. The application
developed is limited in many ways but at the same time can be used by a wide variety of
users for fun. The application can be enhanced by adding playlist functionality and
allowing user to jump to any part of the music.
